          <p class="answer"> A specific moment when code truly clicked for me was the weekend after we learned about media queries. At first, media queries felt intimidating…I had convinced myself they were complicated or required a totally different way of writing CSS. But once I realized that a media query is essentially just a container, and that the CSS inside it works exactly the same as regular CSS, everything suddenly made sense. I literally turned to my fiancé and said, “THIS ALL JUST MADE SENSE!” It was one of the first times I felt coding shift to being intuitive. </p>

        <section id="pit">
            <h2 class="section-headers">The Pit:</h2>
          <p class="answer"> The hardest assignment for me was the Tribute Page. At that point in the quarter, I felt slightly underprepared for a project with that level of structure and design expectation, especially since I chose Christian Dior, which came with a lot of visual pressure. I didn’t want to make the design too busy, but in trying to avoid that, I ended up making it a bit too simple. That challenge ended up being beneficial though. It pushed me to teach myself things and deepen my understanding of concepts like sticky elements. I got myself out of the “pit of despair” by moving on to the next assignment. Starting fresh gave me the mental reset I needed, and building from a clean slate helped everything click into place more naturally. </p>

        <section id="pivot">
            <h2 class="section-headers">The Pivot:</h2>
           <p class="answer"> My final portfolio is a direct translation of my original “Moodz and Vibes” board; I stayed completely true to the plan. From week one, I loved the bright colors, bold contrast, and the overall personality of that mood board. It still feels like an authentic representation of who I am as a designer. Because of that, I didn’t feel the need to pivot; I was excited to bring that board to life. </p>

        <section id="process">
            <h2 class="section-headers">The Process:</h2>
           <p class="answer"> If I could change one thing about how I approached this course, it would be my tendency to compare my work to others’. I knew we were all starting with different levels of coding experience, but since I hadn’t coded since the computer lab in middle school, I often felt behind at the beginning. Looking back, I wish I had focused more on my own growth rather than using others as a benchmark. When I leaned into learning at my own pace, everything became more enjoyable.</p>
        </section>    
      
      <section id="future">
            <h2 class="section-headers">The Future:</h2>
           <p class="answer"> I believe this hybrid skillset will be incredibly impactful for my future practice. Before this class, I knew nothing about code. Now, I feel confident that I can help a client develop a basic website and understand how my design choices translate digitally… not just in print. This expanded toolbox gives me a deeper understanding of design as a whole and opens up additional opportunities that I wouldn’t have been qualified for before. I can genuinely see myself pursuing Web Design more seriously as part of my career.</p>
