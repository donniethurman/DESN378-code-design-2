# DESN 378: Code + Design 2

---

## About This Repository

This is my workspace for **DESN 378 Code + Design 2** also known as **Web Design 2** (or in the future, **Web Design + Code 2**) at Eastern Washington University. **The question this course asks:** How should things behave? In DESN 368, I learned how to make things look right. Here, I'm learning how to make things behave right — treating code as a design material with properties, behaviors, and constraints, just like paint, paper, or clay. Throughout the quarter, I'll work with four digital materials: CSS systems, SVG, animation libraries, and generative code — learning how each responds to manipulation and what each makes possible. Unlike courses focused on user research or backend engineering, this one asks: How does it feel? By the end, this repo will become my portfolio.

## Troubleshooting

### GitHub Pages not deploying

1. Check Settings → Pages → Source is set to "main" branch
2. Wait 2-3 minutes for initial deployment
3. Check the Actions tab for build errors
4. Make sure `index.html` is in the root (not in a subfolder)

### Student benefits expired

1. Go to [GitHub Education](https://education.github.com/benefits)
2. Re-verify with your @ewu.edu email
3. Benefits usually renew within 24-48 hours

### Copilot not suggesting code

1. Make sure GitHub Student Pack is active
2. In VS Code, check that Copilot extension is installed and signed in
3. Try typing a comment describing what you want, then press Enter

### Figma education tier issues

1. Go to Figma → Settings → Account
2. Check if "Education" plan is active
3. If not, re-apply at [figma.com/education](https://figma.com/education)
