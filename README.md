# DESN 378: Code + Design 2

---

## About This Repository

This is my workspace for **DESN 378 Code + Design 2** also known as **Web Design 2** (or in the future, **Web Design + Code 2**) at Eastern Washington University. **The question this course asks:** How should things behave? In DESN 368, I learned how to make things look right. Here, I'm learning how to make things behave right — treating code as a design material with properties, behaviors, and constraints, just like paint, paper, or clay. Throughout the quarter, I'll work with four digital materials: CSS systems, SVG, animation libraries, and generative code — learning how each responds to manipulation and what each makes possible. Unlike courses focused on user research or backend engineering, this one asks: How does it feel? By the end, this repo will become my portfolio.

## Learning Log

Update this section each week with observations, breakthroughs, and questions.
​
## Week 0
​
### What I Learned
This week I learned the importance of JavaScript for interactivity of a website. I also learned the difference between let and const. 
​
​
### What Was Hard
I was frustrated because I didnt understand that I was creating the variables, for some reason I assumed there was only set variables that could be used. 
​
​
### How I Used AI
I used ChatGPT for one of the freeCodeCamp exercises, the problem was that I didnt know hitting enter allowed you to write a new line of code. Once ChatGPT recognized that for me, everything made a lot more sense. 
​
​
### What's Still Unclear
I am confused on the function of the console and if it is used for more then just identifying different variables?
