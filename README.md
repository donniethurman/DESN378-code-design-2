# DESN 378: Code + Design 2

---

## About This Repository

This is my workspace for **DESN 378 Code + Design 2** also known as **Web Design 2** (or in the future, **Web Design + Code 2**) at Eastern Washington University. **The question this course asks:** How should things behave? In DESN 368, I learned how to make things look right. Here, I'm learning how to make things behave right — treating code as a design material with properties, behaviors, and constraints, just like paint, paper, or clay. Throughout the quarter, I'll work with four digital materials: CSS systems, SVG, animation libraries, and generative code — learning how each responds to manipulation and what each makes possible. Unlike courses focused on user research or backend engineering, this one asks: How does it feel? By the end, this repo will become my portfolio.

## Projects

| # | Project | Focus | Status |
|---|---------|-------|--------|
| 1 | The System | Design tokens + theme switching | 🔲 |

# Project 1 Descriptions:
- Project can be found in my learning log at the top of this README (under "portfolio").

Brief description of my token system: My token system equates to my primary background color (--primary-bg-color) and the inverse for dark mode. As well as my three brand primaries. And finally, my text color (--text-color). My spacing tokens are in values of 8, starting at XS all the way to XXL. My typography includes my text font (--primary-body-font), my accent font (--primary-accent-font), and my header font (--primary-header-font).  

Design decisions worth noting: I toned the values of my primary brand colors down for the dark mode version, so it's not just an invert of my light mode. 

Citations for any resources used: 
- Coolors: for deciding the colors for dark mode
- Copilot: for troubleshooting bugs in code for referencing OS.

## Learning Log

Update this section each week with observations, breakthroughs, and questions.
​
## Week 0
​
### What I Learned
This week I learned the importance of JavaScript for interactivity of a website. I also learned the difference between let and const. 
​
​
### What Was Hard
I was frustrated because I didnt understand that I was creating the variables, for some reason I assumed there was only set variables that could be used. 
​
​
### How I Used AI
I used ChatGPT for one of the freeCodeCamp exercises, the problem was that I didnt know hitting enter allowed you to write a new line of code. Once ChatGPT recognized that for me, everything made a lot more sense. 
​
​
### What's Still Unclear
I am confused on the function of the console and if it is used for more then just identifying different variables?

​
## Week 1
​
### What I Learned
I learned the use of a querySelector in a JS file and in the console. 
​
​
### What Was Hard
The most frustrating assignment was the story teller. I felt like there was less direcrion then normal, but I ended up figuring out a lot of things through that frustration. 
​
​
### How I Used AI
I asked AI why my images were responding to my click on the storyteller assignment. 
​
​
### What's Still Unclear
I'm going to practice the story teller extended assignment, because I got it done, but I don't exactly understand what I did.

### Week 2: Remembering Choices
*Coming soon...*

---
​
## Week 2
​
### What I Learned
This week I learned about conditionals and Figma variables. 
​
​
### What Was Hard
The "figma-variables" was slightly hard to follow. I felt like I didnt understand the value of creating the semantic AND regular names. 
​
​
### How I Used AI
I did not use AI this week.
​
​
### What's Still Unclear
I would like to complete the "Story Teller" extra credit (not for points) to deepen my understanding. 
​

## Week 3
​
### What I Learned
I learned the importance of design tokens. As well as the difference between state vs appearance (what the system is vs what it looks like). Also, system preference and how to make a preference stay on refresh.
​
​
### What Was Hard
I struggled with submitting screenshots of the "proof" that my browser was responding to my OS because the instructions were structured for Chrome, and I was on Firefox. Other than that, typical pit of despair stuff...
​
​
### How I Used AI
I used copilot to help me figure out why my JS wasn't pulling my system preference for dark mode and recuded motion. (It was a problem with the order of my JS).
​
​
### What's Still Unclear
Nothing is particulary unclear, I just feel like I have less of a grasp on JS than I did on HTML and CSS at this time last quarter. 

### Work Completed (Week 3)

**Design Tokens**
- [x] variables.css exists
- [x] Color tokens defined
- [x] Typography tokens defined
- [x] Spacing tokens defined
- [x] Tokens used in CSS (no hardcoded values)

**Theme System**
- [x] Uses data-theme on <html>
- [x] Toggle feedback is immediate

**Persistence & Preference**
- [x] Theme saved to localStorage
- [x] Theme persists on refresh
- [x] System preference used on first visit

**Deployment**
- [x] Deployed to GitHub Pages
- [x] Repository is public

​
## Week 4
​
### What I Learned
This week I learned how to create SVGs in an SVG tutorial. As well as how to create a drop down that includes theme switches for light, dark, and OS modes for my portfolio page. I also completed visual notes/research on SVG's. 
​
​
### What Was Hard
The hardest thing this week was the "Theme Dropdown's with Custom SVG's". I had trouble styling the <li> with the SVGs.  
​
​
### How I Used AI
I used AI to help me figure out bugs in my code for the Theme Dropdown assignment. 
​
​
### What's Still Unclear
I am still wrapping my head around the way SVGs work. 

## Week 5
​
### What I Learned
This week I learned about GSAP. As well as how to create and animate SVGs. As well as creating an outline for our final project on scrollytelling. 
​
​
### What Was Hard
Animating SVGs was difficult to do, only because the notes on GSAP are extensive. Being able to go back through the videos and sift through each thing I needed was helpful. 
​
​
### How I Used AI
I didnt use AI much this week on actual code, I did use ChatGPT to help me make my story/narrative map more concise. It was pretty wordy beforehand. 
​
​
### What's Still Unclear
How are these animations going to be triggered by scroll?
​
​
​
## Tools

- **Editor:** VS Code + GitHub Copilot
- **Design:** Figma
- **Hosting:** GitHub Pages
- **Animation:** GSAP (coming Week 5)
